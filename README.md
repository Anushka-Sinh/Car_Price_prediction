A Machine Learning Project used to predict the Car Price in market. A step-by-step flow of methodology:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Exploration
3. Preprocessing
4. test-training data spliting
5. Modelling
6. Models comparison
7. Model Evaluation

 In this project, there are 2 ML algorithms have been used - Linear Regression and Random Forest. This project is for the beginners, who wants to work on the 
 learn and work on ML project from start.
